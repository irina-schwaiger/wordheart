                ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to WordHearts!
                Iâ€™ve picked a 5-letter word. Try to guess it!
                If you see \uD83D\uDC94 under a letter, it means my word doesnâ€™t contain that letter.
                If you see \uD83E\uDDE1, the letter is in the word but in a different position.
                If you see \uD83D\uDC9A, the letter is in the correct position.
                If you get five \uD83D\uDC9A hearts, you win!
                Type your first 5-letter guess below
